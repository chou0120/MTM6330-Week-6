I thought the website was awesome. The photography on the website is great. Each photograph matched the mood of the text written below it. I especially liked the poem, "Sky with limit." It described the sunset in the photograph.

I thought the website was organized in an easily understood manner with the navigation along the top that reduced to a "hamburger icon" once the screen was reduced in size.
The wolf logo matches well with the name of the website. Details are given about the services that are provided, including the prices. 

I thought the "vertical format" of the website that used just one html page was effective.  The use of the Bootstrap classes was done well in the html so that the navigation was easy to use.

The scss styling for the jumbotron class of Bootstrap was done well so that the banner appeared at the top of the page with an input field for the user's email. There was a good use of "nesting" the formatting for a p-tag in the scss of the jumbotron class.

The text formatting and background colours made the text easy to read.

Great website!
